API Documentation
=================

Entry point: :doc:`API of alogos <alogos/index>`

This page documents the application programming interface (API) of the
Python 3 package
:doc:`alogos <../../rst/package_references>`,
which means that it lists and explains all objects this package provides
to programmers and other software. The content of the API documentation
was automatically generated from source code and the docstrings within
it with the tool
`sphinx-autoapi <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi>`_.
The docstring of an object can also be viewed in a Python interpreter
with the built-in
`help() <https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#help>`_
function, as in following example:

.. code-block:: python

   import alogos

   help(alogos.Grammar)
